# Risk Analyse Template

During a course in (ISC)Â² CSSLP, risk analyzes and their prioritization were discussed, among other things. One of the things is that it is often difficult to come to a conclusion about the impact and the probability of a risk. Partly on the basis of this combination, a risk could be prioritized in order to implement mitigating measures.

In the past, as a software tester, I often tested risk-based and I thought that I once built a similar template to simplify my work as a software tester. I have therefore put together a new version in Microsoft Excel. There is a VBA macro in it to prioritize the risks. So if you want to use this template you need to be able to run the macros. If you do not want this, you cannot use the tab in which the risks are prioritized.

Of course you can view the source code yourself to check or make adjustments. You could also sign the VBA macro yourself that you trust.

Obviously, I recommend looking at the source code before running anything from the internet. Viewing the source code can be done in MS Excel with the ```ALT``` + ```F11``` key combination.
